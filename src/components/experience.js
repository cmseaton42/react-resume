This means that the challenges we face daily are often brand new to Bastian and thus we rarely have anything to work from but rather lean on one another as a team address the problem head on.  In my time here, we have worked on everything from large scale system design to smaller R&D projects for some of the most forward-thinking companies in existence.`
